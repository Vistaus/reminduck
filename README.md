</p>

Reminduck is a simple reminder app made to be quick and easy - it focuses on simple or recurrent reminders with set time and date and nothing else.

It's perfect if all you want are simple or daily/weekly/monthly reminders. Anything more than that is not achievable by Reminduck right now - but you can help! Open an issue or a pull request if you have any ideas or requests.

_And it quacks._
